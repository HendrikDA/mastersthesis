This Master’s thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and support of several individuals who contributed to this important milestone in my life.

A debt of gratitude goes to my Mom and Dad for enabling me to pursue higher education. You opened countless doors for me—support I can only hope to honor by continuing to give my best in life. Dankeschön.

To my professor Prof. Dr. Jürgen Jung, thank you for your patience with me during my academic pursuit and for continuously pushing me to achieve more than I could have expected from myself.

Last but not least, thank you to my co-advisor Dr. Rainer Schlör for taking the time to support me during my thesis and for putting so much trust in me and my work.

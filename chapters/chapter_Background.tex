\chapter{Terminology and Technology}
\label{ch:background}
This chapter goes in detail on the terminology and technology that will be relevant for the reader to have a foundational understanding of the rest of this thesis. Later chapters will build upon these concepts and pieces of technology.

\section{Terminology}
\label{sec:background:terminology}

\subsection{Enterprise Architecture Management}
\label{sub:background:eam}
Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) can be summarized as being the bridge between the business and IT departments of an enterprise. The goal is to implement information technology that is aligned with the business needs of the company. This is in contrast to the IT department implementing information technology for the sake of implementing information technology, which people in IT are often fond of doing \cite{ahmed2017motivating}. An unwanted situation would then be when the IT department falls into a siloed way of thinking where they are decoupled from the rest of the company. EAM helps to ensure that the implemented information technology is achieving the right things, namely supporting the business capabilities and processes. \cite[pg. 2-3]{jung2021masterclass}

Enterprise Architecture can benefit a company in various ways. 

% How can this be achieved? what does EAM do in detail?

Diese Quelle hierfür vielleicht verwenden: \cite{jung2019purpose} Die Quelle hat vor allem eine Menge Fragen aus der echten welt, was EAs sich im alltag fragen. diese liste kann als referenz dienen für meinen copilot. Diese Quelle hilft da vielleicht auch nochmal um in die Tiefe zu gehen. \cite{castro2021towards}

\subsection{Enterprise Architect}
\label{sub:background:ea}

A common challenge for an EA is dealing with the heterogenous nature of an application landscape \cite[pg. 6]{jung2021masterclass}

Erwähnen, dass eine Herausforderung des EAs es ist, dass die vorzunehmenden Änderungen zwar von einem high-level POV einfach aussehen, aber in den details viele herausforderungen stecken. zB stakeholder management (jede Applikation hat einen eigenen verantwortlichen, viele schnittstellen der applikationen, etc.)

\subsection{Business Capabilities}
\label{sub:background:capabilities}

% All main types of architecture diagrams, such as application landscapes, capability maps, CS-Matrix, etc.

\section{Technology}
\label{sec:background:technology}


\subsection{Large Language Models}
\label{sub:background:llms}

LLMs are capable of supporting in language-related tasks where text needs to be generated, translated, summarized, analysed, or questions answered \cite{hadi2023large}.

\cite{singhal2023large} describes what llms are and why they are not good with domain specific information and how that causes them to hallucinate.

% Architecture of LLMs

\subsection{Graph Database}
\label{sub:background:graphdb}


\subsection{Retrieval Augmented Generation}
\label{sub:background:rag}


\subsection{neo4j and the Cypher Query Language}
\label{sub:background:neo4j}


\subsection{Model Context Protocol}
\label{sub:background:mcp}
Also explain (maybe in the SOTA) how it is able to understand the schema of the graphdatabase (by calling get-schema	when initializing the MCP it knows how my graph database is setup). 


\subsection{XML and Transpilers}
\label{sec:background:transpilers}
% Important: only describe what XML and a transpiler is here. The methodology subsection will describe what and why the implementation was later.
As will be shown later in section xyz, the working prototype uses a domain-specific, source-to-source transpiler to turn the archimate-exported XML data into Cypher queries to insert the EA data into the graph database.

This source has a bit of good information on why XML is good as a structure language\cite{ruhlemann2017conversation} "Simply speaking, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a data architecture connecting meta-data and data. The architecture's defining feature is the hierar-chical network of nodes. Every node in the XML structure is connected somehow to any other node; also, being a hierarchy, every node is either subordinate or su-perordinate to another node, as shown in the tree structure in Figure 1. Further, XML "provides a standard syntax for the mark-up of data and documents" (Watt 2002:1). The syntax along with the hierarchical network structure make XML doc-uments exhaustively searchable and therefore useful for linguistic research."

More detailed information on the transpiler is described in section xyz.


\subsection{APOC and XPATH}
\label{sec:background:apoc}
Describe how apoc + xpath work and what this has to do with the neo4j cyphers. this might be better in the methodology section as a quick paragraph, but it has to be described somewhere.

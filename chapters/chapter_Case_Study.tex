\chapter{Case Study}
\label{ch:case_study}
With chapter \ref{ch:implementation} describing each component of the prototype, this chapter builds upon this by showcasing experiments and test cases on it.

What we did with the finished prototype and how we tested it. Prompts we used, cases we built, edge cases, etc.

show some test cases here. break down an answer like "i want to remove the application StatManPlus. What do i have to look out for as an enterprise architect?". the returned answer goes into a lot of depth as this is a level 3 question. break down the result of the query and how the result pulls information about the application but also pulls information from the Lehrbuch database.


Idea: create a list of questions over each category with expected answers and see how it performs. also run x amount of experiments and see how many errors came up (e.g. cypher errors) and count the percent of answers that were perfect, good but could be improved, and wrong / faulty.

define that we are building a RAG system which will be referred to as a chatbot. it is not an agent, as it is not executing anything.

Action Research (AR) was applied in order to gain scientific value out of the developed prototype.  The advantage of this research method is that it is very supportive of the development process for information systems. According to Baskerville (1999), all types of action research have the following four characteristics in common: An orientation towards developing, a focus on a specific problem, an iterative process, and a collaboration amongst participants. This is applicable to the work at hand because a prototype is being developed for a specific problem. The development cycle is conducted iteratively and collaboratively with different stakeholders. More details on this are described in chapter \ref{sub:actionResearch} \cite{baskerville1999investigating}
